# 3D-terrain-generation
A Blender-based terrain generation tool that lets artists create 3D landscapes by adjusting simple parameters — no coding or mesh editing required.
This project was built as a final-year university project to simplify procedural terrain workflows for non-technical users.

##Why is terrain important?

●Used in 3D environment

● Used for animation, simulation, and video games

## Features 
- Runs directly inside Blender
- Artists adjust sliders to generate terrain
- No need to write Python or modify the mesh manually
- Real-time updates inside the viewport
- Clean, minimal UI panel inside Blender

## Flow of system

1. User interacts with different parameters in the UI
2. The system processes the parameters
3. Generate terrain with parameters
4. Easily identify and adjust parameters to change when not satisfied
5. Back to step 1

## Installation

1. git clone all the files
2. install requirements.txt
3.  Open Blender
4. Go to scripting
5. load main.py
6. Press run script
7. A user interface will pop out
8. Adjust parameters in the user interface

## Use
After running the script, open the Terrain Generator panel

An artist can control
- Height
- noise
- width
- scale

The 3D mesh update instantly

## Rendering
Artists can render the result by adjusting the shaders, materials by themselves

## Project Overview

### This project demonstrates skills in:
- understand Perlin noise
- algorithms
- mesh construction
- interpolation
- ui design
- Python development
- Blender API

It was created as my final project for university to explore how terrain tools can help artists rapidly experiment with landscapes.
